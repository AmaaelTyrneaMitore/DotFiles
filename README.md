This the current configuration that I use with my **Arch Linux + i3wm** setup. Here, you will find all the configurations related to the apps that I use in my day-to-day workflow with a touch of **Dracula** theme.

# üëÄ Navigation

Here, inside each config directory, you will find a  `README.md` file that will give a little overview of that application's config, for example, *how I use it?*, *how you can use it?*, *and what are the things you need to install/setup to acheive that?*.

# üñºÔ∏è Screenshots

Here are some screenshots of different application running on my i3 window manager on Arch Linux with dracula theme.

# üíñ Contribution

Any types of modifications, suggestions are alwasy welcome since I'm also trying to explore some new possibilites by trying out different combinations and different configs. 

Since this is just the intial setup, I am open to make any changes that you guys might changes to make my configs more elegant and way more sexy.

# üñ•Ô∏è My Setup

- I use a dual screen setup with the bleeding edge **Arch Linux** with  i3 **window manager**. 
-  I use **Brave** as my browser of choice because it is one of the best ones out there.
- As for my IDEs and code editors, usually, I use **Neovim** with an IDE layer of **LunarVim by Christian Chiarulli** with my custom configurations. But occasionally I also use **VS Code** too. But for heavy stuff like Android Development, I like to use **Android Studio** as an IDE.
- For my file managers, I use **Thunar** as my GUI file manager since it is very light weight and lightening fast and I use **Ranger** as a command line file manager since it also utilizes the vim keybinings that I am very famiiliar with. 
- With **i3wm**, I use **Polybar** as the status bar of my choice and related application like **i3blocks**, **i3lock-color** and **i3status** for basic utilities such as displaying blocks in **Polybar** and locking  my screen and so on.
- For my terminal stuff, I use **Kitty** terminal emulator with **fish** shell and on top of that, I use **exa** to replace the `ls` command since it is more elegant than using that, I use **z** for easy navigation throught my files and folder on my systerm so that I won't have to type alll the paths manually and I use **Starship** as my prompt of choice.
- I use **Rofi** as my window switcher and application launcher. It is really useful with extensions like **rofi-calc**, **rofi-emoji** and **rofi-greenclip**.
- I use **xsel** as my clipboard.
- You will also find some custom scripts that I use to do a lot of stuff so if you don't understand anything or if you have any doubt, you can always reach out to me since even I don't remember all the things that I'm using in my day-to-day workflow üòÖ. I will keep updating the READMEs as keep remembering all the things üëçüèª.
